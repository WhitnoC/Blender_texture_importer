# Blender_texture_importer
A small script which imports batches of textures and converts them to materials

# How to use:

+ Open up blender and go to edit/preferences/add_ons:
+ Install the python file in this repository

A UI will appear when the add on is installed, in the 3D_view window.

You can select a root folder, where your textures exist. And also the type of file you wish to import.
